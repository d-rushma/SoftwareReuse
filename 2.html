                        The increasing reliance on cloud-based data storage necessitates
                        robust solutions to address security vulnerabilities associated
                        with traditional encryption methods. This work addressed the
                        critical problem of potential unauthorized access and decryption
                        of sensitive data stored in the cloud by introducing a novel
                        approach to secure cloud data storage. The proposed system
                        utilized integer-based encryption, adding an additional layer of
                        security by converting input data into integers before encryption.
                        Implemented in MATLAB with a user-friendly graphical interface,
                        the system not only enhanced security but also optimizes storage
                        space through the efficient representation of data as integers.
                        The dual-layered encryption strategy ensured that even in the
                        event of a security breach, compromised data remains encrypted,
                        safeguarding sensitive information. The work contributed to

                        Power analysis techniques have emerged as a promising method for
                        detecting hardware Trojans within integrated circuits (ICs). This
                        proposed work explores the application of power analysis in
                        hardware Trojan detection, focusing on the use of power monitors
                        to identify abnormal power consumption patterns associated with
                        Trojan activation. By analyzing the power signatures of ICs during
                        operation, power analysis can uncover subtle deviations indicative
                        of Trojan presence, activation, or malicious behavior. This work
                        begins by providing an overview of hardware Trojans and their
                        potential threats to IC and PCB security, highlighting the need
                        for robust detection methods. It delves into the principles of
                        power analysis, explaining how variations in power consumption can
                        reveal insights into IC behavior and functionality. Specifically,
                        this experiment examines the use of power monitors, which are
                        specialized hardware components capable of accurately measuring
                        power consumption in real-time. Next, this work discussed various
                        power analysis techniques employed in hardware Trojan detection,
                        including static power analysis, dynamic power analysis, and
                        differential power analysis. It explored how these techniques
                        leverage power signatures to identify anomalies associated with
                        Trojan insertion, activation triggers, and malicious payloads.
                        Furthermore, this work presented case studies and experimental
                        results demonstrating the effectiveness of power analysis in
                        detecting hardware Trojans across different IC designs and
                        scenarios. This work discusses challenges and limitations
                        associated with power analysis, such as noise, calibration, and
                        sensitivity to Trojan variations, and propose strategies to
                        address these issues.

                        This is a review report on the research performed and a project
                        built in the field of Information Technology to develop a system
                        for Detecting Fake news to prevent the spread of misinformation
                        that happens through various fake news sites, online media, social
                        media, etc. In this project we made use of some existing solutions
                        for fake news detection like using classical approach, ensemble
                        methods, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and
                        aimed to improve the accuracy of the existing models. The
                        implementation part of the project gave us an idea of how the
                        system works in real world scenarios, its possible use cases and
                        the changes that can be improved or implemented that can enhance
                        the working and utility of the machine learning model.
                        Furthermore, the paper contains a deep analysis about the project
                        architecture along with some important observations made by the
                        authors of the project. These observations were used to achieve
                        better optimization of the proposed system. The machine learning
                        models used in this system were trained on a WELFake dataset which
                        contained over 70,000+ news articles(a mixture of fake and real
                        news). There have been several models and techniques proposed in
                        the past which used the classical machine learning models like
                        Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, deep
                        learning models like CNN, BERT, and Ensemble Techniques were used
                        in the past as well. The maximum accuracy achieved using those
                        models was around 96.11% but we propose a system that has achieved
                        an accuracy of 97% This report is a detailed discussion of how we
                        achieved a higher accuracy, what techniques were used and some
                        samples screenshots of how it might get implemented in the
                        real-world.

                        Identity management is the process of setting and organizing the
                        roles and access privileges of a user’s identity. The current
                        identity management system is centralized and is controlled by a
                        single entity. Users’ privacy concerns are not in their best
                        interest. Users have very little to no control over their data.
                        The centralized system becomes a single point of failure which is
                        prone to attack that leads to users losing their data privacy if
                        these centralized systems are breached. Therefore we propose a
                        Blockchain-based decentralized Identity Management System that
                        makes use of self-sovereign identity, decentralized identifiers,
                        and verifiable credentials. It also gives users the ability to
                        choose from a very large number of identity providers instead of
                        just a select few corporations. The main advantages of the
                        proposed solution include the elimination of the need for a
                        central authority for identity verification and identity data
                        management, the reduction of time spent on identity verification,
                        the ability to share data with permission, and the ability to
                        verify the origin of the data while sharing.

                        sentiment analysis can be referred to. Sentiment analysis
                        identifies and supports a person’s feelings toward a specific
                        material source. Huge amounts of sentiment data are present on
                        social media in the form of tweets, blogs, status updates,
                        postings, etc. The viewpoint of the majority can be expressed
                        extremely effectively using sentiment analysis of this widely
                        generated data. Due to slang, misspellings, and repeated
                        characters, Twitter sentiment analysis is more difficult than wide
                        sentiment analysis. We are aware that each tweet on Twitter can
                        only be 140 characters long. Therefore, it is crucial to determine

                        in message transmission and file transfer over networks using PHP
                        timestamps and whispering technology. In today’s digital
                        landscape, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data
                        during transmission is paramount to safeguarding sensitive
                        information from unauthorized access and tampering. Our proposed
                        system leverages PHP timestamps to generate unique identifiers for
                        messages and files, which are then encrypted using whispering
                        technology to obscure their contents from potential eavesdroppers.

                        Terrorism has proliferated exponentially in certain regions,
                        necessitating urgent action to curb its impact on human lives and
                        property. The widespread adoption of technology, particularly the
                        internet, has facilitated the dissemination of terrorist
                        propaganda through speeches and videos. Terrorist groups exploit
                        online platforms to malign individuals, recruit followers, and
                        incite criminal activities. To counter this threat effectively,
                        the integration of web mining and data mining techniques is
                        imperative. Web mining encompasses diverse text mining
                        methodologies that enable the extraction of pertinent information
                        from unstructured data sources. Text mining plays a crucial role
                        in uncovering patterns, identifying keywords, and extracting
                        significant insights from unstructured textual content. Both data
                        mining and web mining algorithms are instrumental in analyzing
                        structured datasets and extracting valuable information from the
                        vast expanse of web content. However, the varying data structures
                        of websites pose challenges for a singular algorithmic approach.
                        Terrorist groups exploit the internet to spread propaganda and
                        recruit followers through webpages. To counter this threat, web
                        mining and data mining can be used to extract valuable information
                        from vast amounts of web data. Text mining algorithms can then
                        analyze this data to identify patterns and critical information.
                        The internet has become a breeding ground for terrorist
                        activities, used to propagate extremist ideologies and recruit
                        followers. Terrorist organizations leverage web pages to spread

                        Elections are crucial for modern democracies. However, many
                        individuals do not view them as having a significant impact on
                        democracy. Vote-rigging, hacking Electronic Voting Machines

                        of the issues responsible for the growing mistrust over the
                        electoral process. Blockchain is a technology that allows and
                        opens up a possibility for developing a secure and reliable
                        system. This study aims to contribute to the advancement of secure
                        and reliable electoral systems, addressing challenges associated
                        with trust, security, and transparency in traditional voting
                        methods. The blockchain is an emerging, decentralized and
                        distributed technology. It eliminates the need of a third party to
                        manage the access control in the process of election. A voting
                        system that relies on blockchain ensures both the security and
                        integrity of votes, all while maintaining transparency throughout
                        the process. This project contributes to the evolution of a new
                        way of exercising a healthy democracy. This project focuses on
                        implementing a web-based application that facilitates convenient
                        and secure participation for remote voting through computer or a
                        smartphone. We utilise Ethereum blockchain network to implement
                        the project along with MetaMask wallet. To increase the efficiency
                        of the system, we deploy a new and optimized version of the
                        Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm called the
                        Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). This helps the nodes to
                        achieve consensus even in the face of faulty or malicious nodes.

                        Credit card fraud detection using ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
                        Abstract: A credit card is issued by a bank or financial services
                        company that allows cardholders to borrow funds with which to pay
                        for goods and services with merchants that accept cards for
                        payment. Nowadays as everything is made cyber so there is a chance
                        of misuse of cards and the account holder can lose the money so it
                        is vital that credit card companies are able to identify
                        fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not
                        charged for items that they did not purchase. This type of
                        problems can be solved through data science by applying machine
                        learning techniques. It deals with modelling of the dataset using
                        machine learning with Credit Card Fraud Detection. In machine
                        learning the main key is the data so modelling the past credit
                        card transactions with the data of the ones that turned out to be
                        fraud. The built model is then used to recognize whether a new
                        transaction is fraudulent or not. The objective is to classify
                        whether the fraud had happened or not. The first step involves
                        analyzing and pre-processing data and then applying machine
                        learning algorithm on the credit card dataset and find the
                        parameters of the algorithm and calculate their performance
                        metrics.

                        Research delved into the pervasive issue of fake news and limited
                        information literacy through a novel AI system. The system, which
                        utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and
                        Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), offered the following key
                        functionalities. An RNNmodel, trained on a comprehensive dataset
                        of labelled real and fake news articles, was used to analyse news
                        content using NLP. The likelihood of an article being fake news
                        was then predicted by the model. Additionally, legitimate news was
                        categorized into relevant categories (politics, sports, business)
                        using NLP techniques like topic modelling. To address user queries
                        arising from news content, an NLP-powered chatbot was integrated
                        into the project. User questions were understood, and the most
                        relevant and reliable information was provided by the chatbot,
                        leveraging machine learning. The news analysis performed by the
                        first component was drawn upon by the chatbot, guiding users
                        towards trustworthy sources and offering explanations to combat
                        potential biases. The primary objective of the AI system was to
                        empower users to become more discerning consumers of information.
                        Users could readily identify fake news and gained a deeper
                        understanding of legitimate news content. Information literacy was
                        further enhanced by the chatbot, which provided context and
                        facilitated user queries.

                        Fingerprint identification is one of the most popular and reliable
                        personal biometric identification methods. The proposed system
                        consists of a smart card capable of storing the fingerprint of
                        particular person. While issuing the license, the specific
                        person’s fingerprint is to be stored in the card. Vehicles such as
                        cars should have a card reader capable of reading the particular
                        license. The same automobile should have the facility of
                        fingerprint reader device .A person, who wishes to drive the
                        vehicle, should insert the smartcard in the vehicle and then swipe
                        his/her finger. If the fingerprint matches with the fingerprint
                        stored in the smart card then it goes for alcohol detection and
                        seatbelt checking. After passing all authentications, the vehicle
                        will be ignited. The vehicle will not be ignited, if any one of
                        the authentications fails and will not proceed the next step. This
                        increases the security of vehicles and also ensures safe driving
                        by preventing accidents. The prototype of the ignition system is

                        technology that has found its application in various domains. One
                        of the domains that have recently gained attention is vehicle
                        ignition. This technology is used to prevent unauthorized access
                        to the vehicle and ensure that only the authorized driver can
                        start the vehicle. The biometric authentication system typically
                        uses a combination of physiological and behavioural traits to
                        identify the driver, such as facial recognition, fingerprint
                        scanning, recognition, voice recognition, and gait analysis. This
                        paper aims to provide an overview of the biometric authentication
                        system for vehicle ignition, including the advantages,
                        disadvantages, and challenges of implementing such a system. The
                        paper also discusses the different biometric modalities that can
                        be used for authentication, the algorithms used for recognition,
                        and the security aspects of the system. The results show that
                        biometric authentication for vehicle ignition has the potential to
                        increase the security of the vehicle and prevent theft. However,
                        there are still some technical and social challenges that need to
                        be addressed before this technology can be widely adopted.
