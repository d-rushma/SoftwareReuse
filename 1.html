        This article examines how mass incarceration shapes inequality in
        health. The United States leads the world’s mass incarceration rate,
        which disproportionately affects Black Americans. Authors explore the
        ways that incarceration is detrimental to mental and physical health,
        not only of those in jail, but also of their families and especially
        their children.

          “Mass incarceration contributes to racial health disparities in the
          USA across a range of outcomes because of its direct and indirect
          consequences for health, and the disproportionate concentration of
          incarceration among black communities. Because the USA incarcerates
          many more of its citizens than do other developed democracies, mass
          incarceration might have contributed to the country’s lagging
          performance on health indicators such as life expectancy.”

        This article received 281 citations since its publication in 2018. It
        examines how police killings of Black Americans affects the mental
        health of a wide-ranging group of people, not only those connected to
        the victim.&nbsp; For example, the study found that nearly 40% of Black
        American respondents were exposed to one or more police killings of
        unarmed Black Americans in their state of residence in the three months
        prior to the survey. These killings have direct negative mental health
        effects not only for witnesses, but for the wider Black population in
        the United States.

          bolster calls to more accurately measure police killings and provide
          an additional public health rationale to better understand and address
          the potential pathogenic effects of police killings of unarmed black
          Americans and other manifestations of structural racism in the USA.”

        In this study, the authors use data on police-involved deaths to
        estimate the risk of being killed by police use of force in the United
        States across social groups, age, race and gender, using U.S. census
        identification .
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:30px;">
        The study found that Black women and men, , and Latino men face higher
        lifetime risk of being killed by police than do their white peers. The
        study also found that the risk is highest for Black men, who face about
        a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police. The authors state that:

          race, gender, and age. Police violence is a leading cause of death for
          young men, and young men of color face exceptionally high risk of
          being killed by police. Inequalities in risk are pronounced throughout
          the life course. This study reinforces calls to treat police violence
          as a public health issue.”

        <strong>Studying inequity and violence promotes social justice</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:25px;">
        SDG 16 calls for social justice, safety and equality. This goal aims to
        end all forms of injustice, violence and abuse, and ensure that all
        humans have equal rights. As mentioned, the targets of this goal are
        all-encompassing and include stopping the exploitation of children,
        reducing illicit financial and arms flow, and reducing corruption and
        bribery in all their forms. However, &nbsp;despite how broad these
        targets are, two clear research areas stood out in the corpus of studies
        mapped to SDG 16: racial injustice (especially racial biases within the
        United States justice system) and violence against women.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:25px;">
        Racism in the United States and around the world is a long-standing
        issue that permeates almost every facet of daily life. The studies
        highlighted in this article demonstrate the specific toll racial
        injustice has on mental and physical health, which in turn can result in

      <p style="font-size:25px;">
        Another global crisis worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic is violence
        against women, which was the most prevalent topic covered by the overall
        corpus of literature mapped to SDG16. According to the
        <a
          href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/press-release/2021/11/press-release-new-un-women-data-confirms-violence-against-women-has-worsened-due-to-the-covid-19-pandemic"

          rel="noopener"
          >UN Women’s survey data</a
        >
        from 13 countries, almost half of all women reported that they or a
        woman they know experienced a form of violence since the COVID-19
        pandemic.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:25px;">
        We extracted the titles from the top 1,000 cited articles on SDG 16 and
        used a ‘word cloud’ to illustrate the most studied and published papers.
        Within SDG 16, the most recurring topics are those relating to violence
        against women. As can be seen from the word cloud illustration, sexual,
        domestic and intimate partner abuse and violence are the most published
        topics within this area.

        Several interlinking subject areas can be found throughout the SDGs, but
        the intersection between SDG 16 (peace) and SDG 5 (gender equality)
        highlights a point we made at the start of this post: achieving the
        targets of all SDGs is entwined with the success of SDG 16. Conflict and
        injustice aggravate all other crises, particularly those related to
        human rights and equality.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:25px;">
        It is pertinent that research in this area continues to grow and be used
        to define policies, programs and long-term strategies that tackle the
        underlying causes of social injustice—and can withstand unexpected and
        complex global challenges.
