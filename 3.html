          Achieving long-standing peace is imperative for the world’s
          prosperity. Yet today, as we commemorate the International Day of
          Living Together in Peace, it remains elusive. Maintaining peaceful
          societies remains a complex challenge, which at its foundation
          requires accepting individual differences and being able to recognize,
          respect, and appreciate others. The pursuit of peace is at the core of
          the UN’s mission and part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
          Development, with SDG 16 aiming to “promote peaceful, just, and
          inclusive societies for sustainable development.”

        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic">
          For nearly eight decades, the UN has worked toward advancing
          multilateralism to overcome differences and global challenges. The
          International Day of Living Together in Peace aims to “regularly
          mobilize the efforts of the international community to promote peace,
          tolerance, inclusion, understanding, and solidarity, as well as uphold
          the desire to live and act together, united in differences and
          diversity, in order to build a sustainable world of peace, solidarity
          and harmony.” Today this ambitious and essential objective is more
          important than ever.

          With a quarter of the global population living in conflict-affected
          countries, governments, civil society, and communities need to work
          together to resolve disputes. The UN Sustainable Development Solutions
          Network (SDSN) mobilizes global scientific and technological expertise
          to promote practical solutions to implement the 17 SDGs and actively
          supports multilateral efforts that promote peace and accelerate
          progress on SDG 16. The SDSN is playing several key roles that peer
          organizations and other stakeholders should also engage in to further
          the goal of global peace.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic">
          International non-profit organizations have a powerful role to play as
          conveners in support of strengthening multilateralism. For example,
          the SDSN coordinated The Lancet COVID-19 Commission, which launched in
          mid-2020 to assist governments, civil society, and UN institutions in
          responding effectively to the pandemic. Convening world-renowned
          experts across a number of disciplines, including epidemiology,
          humanitarian relief, global health diplomacy, and economics, the
          Commission’s final report calls “for actions to strengthen
          multilateralism, alongside actions to strengthen national health
          systems and preparedness plans to defend against future global health
          threats and achieve sustainable development.” As the foundation for
          peace, multilateralism can help reduce the likelihood of global
          shocks, as well as improve the international community’s resilience,
          including to future pandemics.

        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic">
          The international research community can also strengthen peacebuilding
          efforts through rigorous research on conflict and peace. Further
          research is also needed to look at how we measure concepts, such as
          peace and well-being, as these factors have important implications for
          decision making and public policies. To this end, the World Happiness
          Report, an annual survey and analysis on happiness and well-being as
          indicators of social and economic development, demonstrates that
          greater numbers of people are judging and measuring the success of
          their countries against the welfare of their citizens.

        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic">
          Access to education is also critical to achieving peace and effective
          democracy. It is a potent tool for shaping individuals’ minds,
          viewpoints, and skill sets, and has the power to galvanize political
          movements in support of conflict-free, just, and inclusive societies.
          Yet, far too many people lack access to quality education, and many
          people never pursue lifelong learning opportunities due to constraints
          of time, cost, and availability. A UN Educational, Scientific and
          Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report estimates that 244 million
          children and youth between the ages of 6 and 18 were still missing out
          on school in 2021. The SDG Academy is one example of how we can close
          this gap. The Academy creates and curates free and open educational
          resources on sustainable development, including courses related to
          issues of peace and justice, such as Ethics in Action, Human Rights,
          Human Wrongs, Laudato Si’: On Care for Our Common Home, and
          Environmental Security and Sustaining Peace. The knowledge presented
          in these courses encourages students to think differently about peace
          and justice and offers practical ways to support strong institutions
          and greater equality in our everyday lives.

        <p style="font-size: 25px; font-style: italic">
          The 2030 Agenda and other existing multilateral frameworks, norms, and
          mechanisms provide humanity with a blueprint to solve a myriad of
          issues plaguing societies worldwide. To address today’s geopolitical
          conflicts, the climate emergency, migration crises, and financial
          uncertainty, we must build effective and accountable institutions at
          all levels that support multilateral efforts for peace. Nelson
          Mandela, who devoted his life to the service of humanity and became
          one of the most recognized peacemakers of our time, once said: “Peace
          is not just the absence of conflict; peace is the creation of an
          environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed,
          religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of
          difference.” In this regard, the thematic priorities and strategic
          goals of international organizations and partner stakeholders should
          continue to prioritize equity and human dignity – two universal values
          that are central to achieving the peaceful, inclusive, and sustainable
          future that humanity and the planet deserve.
